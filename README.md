# Welcome to SchedAI

## Introduction

SchedAI is an AI-powereed scheduler. It is developed using the following tech tools. It makes use of Next JS in it's frontend. The styling of the frontned elements is done with the help of tailwind-css. Further the state management of the variables is does with the help of the state management tool called Zustand. It offers seamless integration with Next JS fronts. Next we integrate out backend setup with the help of AppWrite. For enabling the AI part of our app, we will integrate Open AI's API. With the help of relevant prompts, we will try to generate the response expected. 

## List of TechStack Used.
1) Next JS 14:

Next.js is a popular React framework that simplifies and accelerates web development. It provides a robust structure for building React applications with features like server-side rendering, automatic code splitting, and efficient routing. Next.js supports seamless integration with APIs and offers a great developer experience, making it ideal for scalable and performant applications.

2) TailWind CSS:

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework, streamlining web development by offering a set of pre-designed utility classes. Developers leverage these classes directly in HTML, avoiding traditional CSS writing. With a modular and customizable approach, Tailwind enables rapid and consistent styling, promoting efficient and responsive web design.

3) Zustand:

Zustand, a lightweight state management library for React, especially beneficial in Next.js apps, simplifies complex state handling. With a concise API, it provides a centralized store for managing global state, enhancing the development of performant and maintainable applications. Zustand seamlessly integrates with React and supports efficient state updates in Next.js projects.

4) AppWrite:

Appwrite simplifies backend development with its open-source platform. Developers use Appwrite to build scalable web and mobile applications effortlessly. It offers authentication, database, storage, and other essential services, reducing development time and effort. With a user-friendly interface, Appwrite streamlines the backend process, making it an invaluable tool for efficient application development.

5) Open AI: 

OpenAI for developers provides cutting-edge AI tools and models, such as GPT-3.5. Developers leverage OpenAI's APIs to integrate natural language understanding, text generation, and more into their applications. This empowers developers to create innovative solutions, enhancing user experiences and advancing the capabilities of AI-driven applications across various domains.

6) TypeScript:

TypeScript, a Microsoft-developed superset of JavaScript, adds static typing for enhanced code reliability. Offering object-oriented features, seamless JavaScript compatibility, and robust tooling support, TypeScript facilitates scalable and maintainable web development. Its transpilation process catches errors early, promoting a smoother development experience, while its community and ecosystem continue to thrive.
